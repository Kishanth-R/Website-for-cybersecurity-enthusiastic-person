            <h3>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly digital world, cyber threats are rising. According to recent reports, cybercrime costs the global economy over $8 trillion annually, with millions of data breaches occurring each year. Protecting your personal information, business data, and national infrastructure is crucial.</p>
            <p>Key Statistics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over 300,000 new malware variants are detected daily.</li>
                <li>95% of cybersecurity breaches are due to human error.</li>
                <li>The average cost of a data breach is $4.45 million.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="tips">
            <h3>Quick Cybersecurity Tips</h3>
