            <h3>Phishing</h3>
            <p>Phishing is a cyber attack where attackers impersonate trustworthy entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. Common methods include fake emails, websites, or messages that appear legitimate.</p>
            <p><strong>How to recognize:</strong> Unsolicited emails asking for personal information, suspicious links, or urgent requests for action.</p>
            <p><strong>Protection tips:</strong> Verify sender identities, avoid clicking unknown links, and use email filters.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Malware</h3>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, includes viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware designed to harm or exploit devices. It can steal data, disrupt operations, or hold files hostage for ransom.</p>
            <p><strong>Common types:</strong> Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment; spyware monitors activities without consent.</p>
            <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Install reputable antivirus software, keep systems updated, and avoid downloading from untrusted sources.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Scams</h3>
            <p>Online scams involve fraudulent schemes to deceive people into giving away money or information. Examples include fake investment opportunities, lottery scams, or tech support fraud.</p>
            <p><strong>Red flags:</strong> Promises of easy money, pressure to act quickly, or requests for payment via unusual methods.</p>
            <p><strong>Best practices:</strong> Research before investing, never share sensitive information with unsolicited contacts, and report suspicious activities.</p>
        </section>
